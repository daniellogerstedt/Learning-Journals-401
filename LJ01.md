# Learning Journal Number 01

### 17 January 2018

So far 401 has been an interesting course, and I hope to get my hands on more Async code as it seems to be one of the things I struggle with most. Hopefully with some more work I'll get better with Async especially now that I have a better understanding of how the event loop works in JS. I'm kinda looking forward to figuring out how to do the Bitmap lab. It'll be interesting working with an image on a computational level and manipulating it to change certain pixels using code. What I've learned so far this week is that the event loop creates a kind of pseudo-multithreading for JS allowing for the use of async code. It has also been interesting learning more about the Module object and how exporting/importing works between JS objects within the node global scope. As well as the extra information we have covered in regards to scope and contextual this over the first three days has been useful.
