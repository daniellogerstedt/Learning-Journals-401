# Learning Journal Number 01

### Wednesday January 24th, 2018

So far I'm really enjoying backend work, the tcp chat server lab was fun to make and has given me some ideas for projects to work on outside class in my spare time. It'll be nice to start learning mongoDB next week so that I have knowledge of how more than one type of database works. I'm also really thinking about learning how simple AI's work and trying to build one from the ground up rather than working with one of the libraries available already.
